## Code of Conduct

This project and its participants are governed by our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository**
2. **Clone your fork**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/nexadatamesh-lineage.git
   cd nexadatamesh-lineage
   ```
3. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Java 17 or higher
- Maven 3.8.0 or higher
- Node.js 18 or higher (for web UI)
- Docker and Docker Compose (for local development)

### Local Development

1. **Start the development environment**
   ```bash
   cd development
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. **Build the project**
   ```bash
   mvn clean compile
   ```

3. **Run the API**
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run -pl api
   ```

4. **Run the web UI**
   ```bash
   cd web
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

## Code Style

### Java Code

We use the following tools to maintain code quality:

- **Spotless**: Code formatting (Google Java Format)
- **PMD**: Static code analysis
- **JaCoCo**: Code coverage
- **Maven Enforcer**: Build rules

Run code quality checks:
```bash
mvn spotless:check
mvn pmd:check
mvn test jacoco:report
```

### TypeScript/JavaScript Code

- **ESLint**: Code linting
- **Prettier**: Code formatting
- **TypeScript**: Type checking

Run web code quality checks:
```bash
cd web
npm run lint
npm run type-check
```

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
mvn test

# Run specific module tests
mvn test -pl api

# Run with coverage
mvn test jacoco:report
```

### Writing Tests

- Write unit tests for all new functionality
- Aim for at least 80% code coverage
- Use descriptive test names
- Follow the AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)

## Pull Request Process

1. **Update documentation** if needed
2. **Add tests** for new functionality
3. **Ensure all tests pass**
4. **Update the changelog** if applicable
